# Hello World!                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                      
The "*beverage selector*" application in this folder is the application created in steps [5 thorugh 8](https://touchgfx.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205443722) in the very first tutorial on the [TouchGFX Help Center](https://touchgfx.zendesk.com/hc), complete with code and assets.


Dumping this application in the `app/` folder of your TouchGFX installation at `app/tutorials/01_hello_world` ensures that the relative reference to the TouchGFX framework is correct.
