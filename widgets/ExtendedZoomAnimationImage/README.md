Purpose
========

The purpose of the ExtendedZoomAnimationImage widget is to extend the ZoomAnimationImage widget (found in the TouchGFX framework from version 4.1.1) with an additional static bitmap size.

This is for the case where you want to animate between three possible sizes instead of two.

TouchGFX Version
=================

This widget was created and tested using TouchGFX version 4.1.1

Functional description
======================

The use of the widget is as for the standard ZoomAnimationImage except that setBitmap(..) takes three bitmaps instead of two.
