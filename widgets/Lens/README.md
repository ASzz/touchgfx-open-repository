Purpose
========

![example](screenshots/lens-effect.png "Resulting lens effect")

The purpose of the Lens is to provide an effect on top of already existing graphics. The lens will distort the contents below it. 

The lens has a radius of 100. This number can be adjusted. 

The lens adds an image of a semi transparent glass on top of the distorted graphics. If the radius of the lens is adjusted, additional image data may be needed for the glass.

Note that the lens is more dependent on the contents of the framebuffer and therefore the order of drawing than more regular widgets.
