Purpose
========

![example](screenshots/img00.bmp "Example")

The purpose of the Carousel widget is to provide an nice looking carousel functionality that does not use up a lot of MCU resources. 

The Carousel widget is hardcoded to 5 visible elements. It should, however, not be a big task to change this number if needed.

Please note that the Carousel widget uses the ExtendedZoomAnimationImage.hpp. This widget can also be found in the TouchGFX Open Widget Repository. This file is included in the Carousel.hpp file and uses the path gui/common/ExtendedZoomAnimationImage.hpp. If you place the hpp file in another location simply change the include path as well.
