You can use TouchGFX to create modern user interfaces with a smartphone-like look and feel on hardware platforms an order of magnitude less powerful (48-216 Mhz) than smartphones.\r\n\r\nThis repository, the *TouchGFX Open Repository*, contains numerous examples of, and ideas for, graphical components such as widgets, containers and \"mixins\" that are not part of the core distribution. They can be used as a source of inspiration for your applications free of charge; The components are all generalized to some extent but probably needs some sort of fine tuning to match your specific needs. Please note that none of the components are guaranteed to be maintained across new versions of TouchGFX. \r\n\r\nYou can request a full evaluation version of the framework, as well as order commercial licenses, on the [TouchGFX website](http://touchgfx.com/product-details/evaluation/). Read more about the concept of widgets, containers and \"mixins\" in the TouchGFX [documentation](http://touchgfx.com/documentation/html/index.html).\r\n\r\n[![TouchGFX Demo on STM32F429 Evaluation Board 4.3\"](http://img.youtube.com/vi/QcKX_Pc6ldU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKX_Pc6ldU \"TouchGFX Demo on STM32F429 Evaluation Board 4.3\")\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n* [Website] (http://touchgfx.com)\r\n* [Documentation] (http://touchgfx.com/documentation/html/index.html)\r\n\r\n# License Terms\r\n\r\nAll software, including widgets, containers and mixins and codes found in this repository (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Software”) are available to download free of charge and the Software may be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
