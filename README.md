TouchGFX is a framework written in C++ that enables you to create modern graphical user interfaces on embedded systems with limited resources. That means a smartphone-like look and feel on hardware an order of magnitude less powerful than smartphones, e.g. ARM Cortex M3-M4 48-204 MHz.

On the TouchGFX website you can request a full evaluation version of the framework as well as order a commercial license. 

Read more about the framework in the product [documentation](http://touchgfx.com/documentation/html/index.html).
